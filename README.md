This repository contains two main folders:
python_basics/ (contains datatypes.py, control_structures.py, modular_functions.py)
numpy_intro/ (contains numpy_basics.py).

The purpose of datatypes.py is to:
-Create variables of different Python data types (int, float, complex, list, tuple, dict, set, and bool).
-Print the values and their corresponding types using Python’s type() function.
-Convert an integer to a float and vice versa to understand type conversions.

how to run the script:
Click anywhere inside datatypes.py.
Right-click and select Run 'datatypes' (or use the shortcut Shift + F10).
The output will be displayed in the Run window at the bottom.

What I Learned from This Exercise:
✅How to define and use different data types in Python.
✅How to check the type of a variable using type().
✅How to convert data types using int(), float(), and complex().
✅How Python treats different data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
✅How Boolean expressions evaluate to True or False.

The script(control_structures) demonstrates the use of control structures in Python. It performs the following tasks:
-Takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is even or odd.
-Uses a for loop to generate a list of even numbers from 1 to 50 and prints them.
-Uses a while loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1 in reverse order.

Right-click and select Run 'datatypes' (or use the shortcut Shift + F10).
The output will be displayed in the Run window at the bottom.

What I Learned from This Exercise
✅How to take user input in Python and process it.
✅How to use functions to classify numbers as even or odd.
✅How to use a for loop to iterate over a range and filter numbers.
✅How to use a while loop for countdown logic.
✅Improved understanding of control structures in Python.

The script(modular_functions) calculates the area of three different shapes: circle, rectangle, and triangle, using a modular function.

how to run the script:
Click anywhere inside datatypes.py.
Right-click and select Run 'datatypes' (or use the shortcut Shift + F10).
The output will be displayed in the Run window at the bottom.

What I Learned from This Exercise
✅How to write modular Python code using functions.
✅ How to handle default parameters in function definitions.
✅ How to use loops to test multiple cases efficiently.
✅ How to format output using string formatting (.2f for 2 decimal places).
✅ Improved understanding of conditionals and return values.

The script(numpy_basics)demonstrates how to create a NumPy array, print its contents, and retrieve its shape (i.e., the number of rows and columns).

how to run the script:
Click anywhere inside datatypes.py.
Right-click and select Run 'datatypes' (or use the shortcut Shift + F10).
The output will be displayed in the Run window at the bottom.

What I Learned from This Exercise:
✅How to import and use the NumPy library.
✅How to create a 2D NumPy array.
✅How to print the array.
✅How to check the shape of the array, which tells the number of rows and columns.
